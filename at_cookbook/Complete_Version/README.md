# at_cookbook

This is an intermediate-level @protocol application that uses the verbs we learned in the `at_hello_world` application to make a working cookbook for the chef inside of us all!

## Demo

What you see is the home page of the application. You can add and delete dishes freely with a lot of custom content!

## Getting Started

Clone this application from the `at_demos` repository. If you haven't used the `at_hello_world` app yet, we highly encourage you to check that out first. Make sure that your virtual environment (i.e. Docker containers) are running whenever you use an @protocol application.
