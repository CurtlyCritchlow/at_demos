# at_cookbook

This directory contains the incomplete version of the at_cookbook application. Complete the TODOs to get it working!

## Other Screen

1. Complete the `_getSharedKeys()` function to retrieve a list of keys for dishes that are shared with you.
2. Complete the  `_getSharedRecipes()` function so that it returns a `Map` of a dish's title to its attributes.

## Dish Page

1. Implement the `_delete()` verb so that a user can remove dishes from their feed. Pay close attention to the constructor of the `home_screen.dart` class.

## Share Screen

1. Complete the `_share()` function so that it notifies another @sign's secondary server of a shared recipe.
